# Welcome to End to End Data Science Project (Student Performance) 🚀

## 1. Git and Github Repository Setup
    a. **Commiting the code using Git in Github.**
        - Make README.md, requirements.txt
        - Initialize the Git Repo in this Folder.
            ```
            git init  # Write this in the terminal
            ```
        - Go to Add file there and make two things: `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`
        - Come Back to Local and there make the Virtual environment and never push this venv to GitHub...add this name to `.gitignore` so that it will be ignored while pushing things to GitHub.
        
        b. **Creating the Virtual environment and activating this.**
            - Creating an environment for this project...in cmd or bash (use `source` to activate venv here)
            ```
            conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y
            conda activate venv/  # or conda activate ./venv  # These both work
            ```
        
        c. **Adding Things to README.md and writing the required packages in `requirements.txt`.**
            - Installing the required packages using 
            ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            ```

        d. **Push these things to GitHub Repo.**
            - Using GUI of VSCode or `git add name_of_file` or `git add .` (to add all the files at once).

## 2. Project Setup
    - Creating `requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
