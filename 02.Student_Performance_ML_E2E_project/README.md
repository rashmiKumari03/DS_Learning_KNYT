# Welcome to End to End Data Science Project Setup Guide (Student Performance) ðŸš€


### A. Git and Github Repository Setup

   1. Make README.md, requirements.txt
   2. Initialize the Git Repo in this Folder. 
        ```bash
        git init 
        ```
   3. Add `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` files.
   4. Create a Virtual Environment and activate it.
        ```bash
        conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y
        conda activate venv/
        ```
   5. Add virtual environment (`venv/`) to `.gitignore`.
   6. Update README.md with project details.
   7. Write required packages in `requirements.txt` and install them.
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
   8. Push changes to Github Repo.
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit"
        git remote add origin <repository_url>
        git push -u origin master
        ``
   9. After installing requirements.txt also install ipykernel (to use jupyter notebook).
       ```bash
       pip install ipykernel
       ```
     (if while using ipynb --> importing pandas says --> To install Pyarrow 
      --> then install it also in terminal using --> pip install Pyarrow)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### B. Project Setup
   
   1. Creating `template.py` to make different directories just in one shot.
   2. Creating `setup.py` and add `-e .` into requirements.txt
      ```
      This setup.py file is very important , because this will make the Folder/application as package...and we can even push it to PyPi and anyone can use it as package.Here we can add various informations about the package also who created it,on which date and so many things.
      ```
   

       











This setup guide aims to streamline the process of initializing a data science project, ensuring proper version control with Git, and maintaining a clean project structure. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
